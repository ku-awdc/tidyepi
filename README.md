	# If the devtools package is not already installed:
	install.packages('devtools')
	# Install the package from github:
	devtools::install_github('ku-awdc/tidyepi')
	# Load and launch the shiny server UI:
	library('tidyepi')
	tidyepi()
	
Alternatively you can try out the interface provided at our [shiny webserver]()
